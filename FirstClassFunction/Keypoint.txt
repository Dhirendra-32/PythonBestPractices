Key Takeaways

    • Everything in Python is an object, including functions. You can
    assign them to variables, store them in data structures, and pass
    or return them to and from other functions (first-class functions.)
    
    • First-class functions allow you to abstract away and pass
    around behavior in your programs.
    
    • Functions can be nested and they can capture and carry some
    of the parent function’s state with them. Functions that do this
    are called closures.
    
    • Objects can be made callable. In many cases this allows you to
    treat them like functions.
